# What is ROS 2?

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. It is not an operating system in the traditional sense, like Windows, Linux, or macOS. Instead, it is a flexible framework that provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster such as hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management.

ROS 2, the second generation of ROS, is a complete redesign of the original ROS framework. It is built on top of the **Data Distribution Service (DDS)** standard, which provides a real-time, publish-subscribe messaging system. This makes ROS 2 more suitable for production environments, multi-robot systems, and real-time applications.

In this module, we will be using ROS 2 as the "nervous system" for our humanoid robot. It will allow us to create a network of independent nodes that can communicate with each other to perform complex tasks.
