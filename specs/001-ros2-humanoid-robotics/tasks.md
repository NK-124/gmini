# Tasks: Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-ros2-humanoid-robotics/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Docusaurus Project Initialization)

**Purpose**: Initialize the Docusaurus project.

- [X] T001 Initialize Docusaurus project in the `my-website` directory with npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic.
- [X] T002 Update `my-website/docusaurus.config.js` with basic project metadata (title, tagline, URL, baseUrl).

## Phase 2: Foundational (Docusaurus Configuration)

**Purpose**: Configure Docusaurus for Module 1.

- [X] T003 [P] Create `my-website/docs/module1` directory.
- [X] T004 Configure `my-website/sidebars.js` to include `my-website/docs/module1` with autogenerated content.
- [X] T005 Create `my-website/src/css/custom.css` for basic styling.

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Understand ROS 2 Fundamentals (P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Provide foundational knowledge on ROS 2 for physical AI.

**Independent Test**: The "Introduction to ROS 2 for Physical AI" chapter is accessible and explains ROS 2 fundamentals.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T006 [P] [US1] Create markdown file `my-website/docs/module1/intro-to-ros2.md`.
- [X] T007 [US1] Write content for `my-website/docs/module1/intro-to-ros2.md` explaining ROS 2, its importance for humanoids, and DDS concepts.

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Learn ROS 2 Communication (P2)

**Goal**: Explain ROS 2 communication models.

**Independent Test**: The "ROS 2 Communication Model" chapter is accessible and explains ROS 2 communication models.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T008 [P] [US2] Create markdown file `my-website/docs/module1/ros2-communication-model.md`.
- [X] T009 [US2] Write content for `my-website/docs/module1/ros2-communication-model.md` covering Nodes, Topics, Services, and a basic `rclpy` example.

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Define a Robot Structure (P3)

**Goal**: Explain URDF for robot structure definition.

**Independent Test**: The "Robot Structure with URDF" chapter is accessible and explains URDF.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T010 [P] [US3] Create markdown file `my-website/docs/module1/robot-structure-urdf.md`.
- [X] T011 [US3] Write content for `my-website/docs/module1/robot-structure-urdf.md` explaining URDF for humanoid robots and simulation readiness.

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Review and finalize the module.

- [X] T012 Review all generated markdown content for clarity, correctness, and adherence to style guidelines.
- [X] T013 Ensure all chapters are correctly linked in `my-website/sidebars.js`.
- [X] T014 Verify the Docusaurus project builds successfully (`cd my-website && yarn build`).
- [X] T015 Verify the Docusaurus project runs locally (`cd my-website && yarn start`).

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately.
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion.
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion.
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete.

### User Story Dependencies

- User stories can be implemented in parallel after the Foundational phase, but are prioritized P1 -> P2 -> P3.

### Within Each User Story

- Creating markdown files can be done in parallel with other file creations.
- Writing content for markdown files is sequential for each file.

### Parallel Opportunities

- Tasks marked with `[P]` can be executed in parallel. For example, `T003` and `T004` can be done in parallel.
- Markdown file creation tasks (`T006`, `T008`, `T010`) can be executed in parallel.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently by running Docusaurus locally.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo

---

## Notes

- Each user story should be independently completable and testable.
- Verify Docusaurus project runs after each major phase.
