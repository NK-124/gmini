# Research: Docusaurus Project Initialization

## Decision: Use Docusaurus v2

**Rationale**: Docusaurus is a modern static website generator that helps you get up and running with a content-focused website quickly. It's built using React, which allows for a rich user experience. It's also well-suited for documentation websites, which is the core of this project.

**Alternatives considered**:

- **GitBook**: A popular platform for documentation, but it's a hosted service and we want to self-host on GitHub Pages.
- **Jekyll**: A popular static site generator, but it's Ruby-based and the team is more familiar with JavaScript.
- **Hugo**: A very fast static site generator, but it's Go-based and has a steeper learning curve.
