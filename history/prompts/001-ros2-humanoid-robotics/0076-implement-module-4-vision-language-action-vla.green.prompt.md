## Prompt

Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
Focus: The convergence of LLMs and Robotics.
Voice-to-Action: Using OpenAI Whisper for voice commands.
Cognitive Planning: Using LLMs to translate natural language ("Clean the room") into a sequence of ROS 2 actions.
Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid. A final project where a simulated robot receives a voice command, plans a path, navigates obstacles, identifies an object using computer vision, and manipulates it.

## Response snapshot

I have now created all the new markdown files for Module 4 and updated the sidebar. You should now see "Module 4" in the navigation.

Please restart your development server to see the final changes.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully implemented Module 4 with detailed content and a nested structure.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 5 directories created, 14 files created, 1 file modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User can now review the new Module 4 content.
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of creating a new module is now well-established and can be easily replicated for future modules.
