## Prompt

Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
Focus: Advanced perception and training.
NVIDIA Isaac Sim: Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation.
Isaac ROS: Hardware-accelerated VSLAM (Visual SLAM) and navigation.
Nav2: Path planning for bipedal humanoid movement.

## Response snapshot

I have now created all the new markdown files for Module 3 and updated the sidebar. You should now see "Module 3" in the navigation.

Please restart your development server to see the final changes.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully implemented Module 3 with detailed content and a nested structure.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 5 directories created, 14 files created, 1 file modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User can now review the new Module 3 content.
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of creating a new module is now well-established and can be easily replicated for future modules.
