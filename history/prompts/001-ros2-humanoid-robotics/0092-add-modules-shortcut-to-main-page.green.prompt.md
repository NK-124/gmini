## Prompt

add modules shortcut on main pages

## Response snapshot

Successfully modified file: C:\Users\hp\OneDrive\Desktop\gmini\my-website\src/pages/index.js (1 replacements).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Added a "Modules" button to the main page to provide a shortcut to the documentation.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Modified my-website/src/pages/index.js to add the "Modules" button.
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of creating a PHR was complicated by the lack of a clear and working script. I had to manually create the PHR file.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The initial attempts to use the PHR creation scripts failed.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): none
