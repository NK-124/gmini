## Prompt

this is module 2 implement it like module 1
Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
Focus: Physics simulation and environment building.
Simulating physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo.
High-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity.
Simulating sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs.

## Response snapshot

I have now created all the new markdown files for Module 2 and updated the sidebar. You should now see "Module 2" in the navigation.

Please restart your development server to see the final changes.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully implemented Module 2 with detailed content and a nested structure.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 5 directories created, 11 files created, 1 file modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User can now review the new Module 2 content.
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of creating a new module is now well-established and can be easily replicated for future modules.
