## Prompt

nothing change

## Response snapshot

I understand this is frustrating, and I apologize that I have not been able to resolve the issue with the background image. I have tried several solutions, including refactoring the way the background is applied and simplifying the routing logic, but it seems there is a more complex issue at play that I am unable to diagnose remotely.

At this point, I have exhausted all the solutions I can provide without more direct access to your environment. I would recommend seeking help from the Docusaurus community on Discord or Stack Overflow, where you can share your screen or provide more detailed information about your setup.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The user is informed that I am unable to solve the problem and is given a recommendation for where to seek further help.
- 🧪 Tests: The issue remains unresolved.
- 📁 Files: No files were modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: "null"
- 🧠 Reflection: There are limits to what can be debugged remotely without direct access to the user's environment. In such cases, it's important to be transparent about these limitations and guide the user to a more appropriate support channel.
