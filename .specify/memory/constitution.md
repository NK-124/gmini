# Humanoid Robot Design Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Humanoid Form Factor
Design a humanoid, animation-ready 3D robot body.

### II. Aesthetic and Appearance
Prioritize clean geometry, smooth joints, and friendly appearance.

### III. Material and Lighting
Use matte white and silver materials with subtle cyan glow at joints.

### IV. Style and Quality
Style must be Pixar/Blender-quality, semi-realistic, softly lit.

### V. Content Restrictions
No weapons, no human skin, no logos, no cluttered backgrounds.

### VI. Production Readiness
Output must be rig-friendly and production-ready.

## Key Standards

- Clean geometry suitable for animation.
- Matte white and silver primary materials.
- Subtle cyan emissive material for joint highlights.
- High-quality, semi-realistic rendering in the style of Pixar/Blender.
- Model topology must be rig-friendly for production workflows.

## Constraints

- The robot must not have any features that could be interpreted as weapons.
- The robot must not have any features that resemble human skin.
- No third-party logos or branding may appear on the robot.
- The background for any renders must be simple and not cluttered.

## Success Criteria

- A production-ready, rig-friendly 3D model of a humanoid robot is delivered.
- The model has a friendly and non-threatening appearance.
- The final renders adhere to the specified material, lighting, and style guidelines.

## Governance

This constitution is the single source of truth for project principles and standards. Any amendments require a formal proposal, review, and approval process. All contributions to the project must adhere to the principles outlined in this document.
