# AI-Driven, Spec-First Technical Book with Integrated RAG Chatbot Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Specification-First Development
Specification-first development approach powered by Spec-Kit Plus. All features must begin with a clear and approved specification.

### II. Strict Technical Correctness
Strict technical correctness derived from official and authoritative sources. All technical content must be verifiable and accurate.

### III. Concise, Developer-Centric Documentation
Concise, developer-centric documentation and explanations. Documentation should be easy to understand and targeted at a technical audience.

### IV. Repeatable Processes
Fully repeatable setup, build, and deployment process. All development and deployment workflows must be automated and reproducible.

## Key Standards

- Technical book authored using Docusaurus and published via GitHub Pages.
- Embedded RAG chatbot that responds exclusively using book content or explicitly user-selected text.
- Technology stack includes OpenAI Agents/ChatKit, FastAPI, Neon Postgres, and Qdrant Cloud.
- Codebase must be executable, maintainable, and thoroughly documented.

## Constraints

- Source control managed entirely through GitHub.
- Responses must be strictly grounded with zero hallucinations.
- Complete end-to-end reproducibility across all components.

## Success Criteria

- Book is publicly accessible and live on GitHub Pages.
- Embedded RAG chatbot is fully operational and functionally complete.
- All specifications are implemented in accordance with Spec-Kit Plus.

## Governance

This constitution is the single source of truth for project principles and standards. Any amendments require a formal proposal, review, and approval process. All contributions to the project must adhere to the principles outlined in this document.
